# Minimal Decomposition Entropy in AME States

## Table of Contents

- [Code Examples and Implementation](#code-examples-and-implementation)
- [Newly Discovered AME States](#newly-discovered-ame-states)
- [Optimal Representation of AME States](#optimal-representation-of-ame-states)

## Code Examples and Implementation

- Python code implementing the algorithms can be found in the `python-code` folder. Modify as needed.
- `entropy.py`: Computes the minimal decomposition entropy for \( q = 2 \) (ququad states, \( N = 4, d = 2 \)).
- `generate_ame.py`: Generates AME(6,2) states.

## Newly Discovered AME States

- Newly discovered AME states are provided as NumPy files in the `ensemble-maximum` folder.
- To load the states, run the Python file `load_states.py`.

## Optimal Representation of AME States

- The AME states and the corresponding local unitary matrices obtained from the algorithm are provided in the `optimal-representation` folder in `.pickle` format.
- To load the states, run the Python file `load_states.py`.
